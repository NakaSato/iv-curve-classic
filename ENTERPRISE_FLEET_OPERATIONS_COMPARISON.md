## Health Scoring Algorithm Transformation

### Old Algorithm Issues
```
- Simple variance-based scoring: health_score = max(0, 100 - variance_factor)
- Single factor analysis (string imbalance only)
- Poor differentiation between systems
- Most systems showed "critical" health (0-20 range)
- No consideration of operational context
```

### New Enterprise Algorithm
```
Weighted Composite Health Score = 
  (Efficiency Score × 30%) +
  (String Balance Score × 25%) +
  (Temperature Score × 20%) +
  (Fault Status Score × 15%) +
  (Power Stability Score × 10%)

With graduated scoring thresholds:
- Excellent: 90-100
- Good: 80-89  
- Fair: 70-79
- Poor: 60-69
- Critical: <60
```
