## Technical Implementation Details

### Configuration File Structure
```toml
[pv_module]
name = "ZXM7-UHLD144 570W"
manufacturer = "ZNSHINESOLAR"
technology = "16BB HALF-CELL N-Type TOPCon Double Glass Monocrystalline"
rated_power_stc = 570.0
temp_coeff_voc = -0.25e-2    # Real manufacturer coefficient
temp_coeff_isc = 0.048e-2    # Real manufacturer coefficient
temp_coeff_power = -0.30e-2  # Real manufacturer coefficient
```

### Mathematical Models Implemented
1. **Temperature Correction:**
   ```
   VOC(T) = VOC_STC + (T - T_STC) × TC_VOC × N_cells
   ISC(G,T) = ISC_STC × (G/G_STC) × (1 + TC_ISC × (T - T_STC))
   ```

2. **Performance Assessment:**
   ```
   Fill Factor = (VMP × IMP) / (VOC × ISC)
   Health Score = f(FF, Rs, Rsh, thresholds)
   ```
